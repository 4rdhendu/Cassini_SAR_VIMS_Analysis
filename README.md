# Cassini VIMS & RADAR Analysis:
# Automatic processing of SAR/VIMS data that acquired from Cassini mission on Titan


The repo contains scripts for automatic processing of Cassini SAR/VIMS with the use of USGS' Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS3) and MatLab. There are also some MatLab files to make 3D approximations and videos of the terrain like the following one (Click on the image to see the video)
